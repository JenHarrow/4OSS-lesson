# 4OSS-lesson

[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v2/open-source.png?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badge/)    


## Overview

Lesson development hackathon for teaching best practices in research software development is
based on four simple recommendations [1] (4OSS). We are adopting the Carpentries approach and policy for training material
development and maintenance to help us in providing clear guidelines on how to implement the 4OSS recommendations.
