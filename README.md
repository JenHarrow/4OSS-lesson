# 4OSS-lesson

## Overview

Lesson development hackathon for teaching best practices in research software development is
based on four simple recommendations [1] (4OSS). We are adopting the Carpentries approach and policy for training material
development and maintenance to help us in providing clear guidelines on how to implement the 4OSS recommendations.

During CarpentryCon the first brainstorming workshop we have defined the contents for the hackathon in August 2018.
